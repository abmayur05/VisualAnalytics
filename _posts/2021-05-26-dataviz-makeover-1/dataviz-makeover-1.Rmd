## 1.0 Critique of Visualisation

The original visualisation can be seen below.

<center>
![Figure 1: Given visualization](img/1.jpg)

</center>
### 1.1 Clarity

1.  The title of the chart says that the chart represents merchandise trade of the top six trading countries from 2019 to 2020. But most of the sub-charts have years ranging from 2019 to 2021. Moreover, the chart corresponding to Japan has only the year 2020 in its x-axis. In addition, the title just states the top six trading countries but whether those are the top six trading countries in the world or the top six trading countries with Singapore is not clear to the reader. 
2.	The y-axis scale for all 6 different countries is not consistent. The chart represents China and Japan to have similar export and import trends, in-fact Japan’s trade seems to be more than that of China but having a closer look at the y-axis reveals that China’s scale is from 0M-8M whereas Japan’s scale is only from 0M-2M. So all axis of the countries should be consistent with each other and also the dual-axis present in the y-axis should be synchronized as they represent exports and imports of the same country.
3.	The x-axis is labeled as ‘Month of Period’ but the x-axis tick mark values correspond to year and not the month.
4.	Unit of measurement is nowhere mentioned in the graph. Since there are six different countries with different currencies, it is important to mention the unit of measurement.
5.	The source of the chart is not present.
6.	Area chart is mostly preferred only to show how parts of a whole change over time. From our area chart, it is very hard to infer any insights. It is always recommended to avoid using a classic area chart as it is too confusing.

### 1.2 Aesthetics

1.	The use of colors to distinguish exports and imports is too pale. And since most of the sub-charts have overlapping of two colors, it is very hard to understand. Brighter and distinct coloration is always preferred.
2.	The font size of the main title for the chart is smaller than the other secondary titles such as the country names in the chart.
3.	Tick marks are not present in the y-axis. Tick marks are necessary on a continuous scale.
4.	The secondary headers such as country names present in the chart are left-aligned. And since there are no gridlines, at times it gets confusing.
5.	Annotations are not used to convey the key insights, leaving the reader to infer the purpose of the chart.

## 2.0 Alternative Design

The proposed design is as follows.

<center>
![Figure 2: Proposed Sketch](img/2.png)

</center>
### 2.1 Clarity

1. The x-axis of all the countries has the same year range as mentioned in the main title of the chart. 
2. The area chart is replaced by a stacked bar chart which gives the overall picture of the total trade as well as the exports and imports value in the corresponding year.
3. Line chart is used on top of the stacked bar chart to show the rate of increase/decrease in trade value from that of the previous year. The percentage increase/decrease is also displayed in the chart to quantify the rate of change.
4. All six countries share the same y-axis so that it will be easy to compare and draw insights.
5. Link to the source and raw data are provided at the bottom of the chart.
6. Unit of measurement is clearly mentioned in the y-axis as there are different countries using different currencies.
7. The raw data excel file has a scale of thousand dollars so all the values are multiplied by 1000 to get the actual value of exports and imports.

### 2.2 Aesthetics

1.	In the y-axis, tick marks are added since the values are on a continuous scale. In addition, the tick marks were also changed to black color to make them visible to the naked eye.
2.	Soft and natural colors are used to distinguish export and import.
3.	Grid lines are used to separate six different countries.
4.	Annotations are used to emphasize key observations. 
5.  Numbers with too many digits are always difficult to interpret for the readers, hence all the values are converted to billions for easy reference.

## 3.0 Proposed Visualisation

Please view the interactive visualization on [Tableau Public](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mayurapriyann/) here.

## 4.0 Step-by-step Guide

1.	Import the excel sheet(outputFile.xlsx) into Tableau Prep builder. The first five rows in the excel sheet contains non tabular data which needs to be excluded.

<center>
![Figure 3: Raw Excel Sheet](img/3.jpg)

</center>

Check the ‘Data Interpreter’ check box to handle this issue. It is designed to help identify the structure of the data in excel file and turn it into a proper format. 

<center>
![Figure 4: Data Interpreter](img/4.jpg){width=40%}

</center>
2.	Rename the first sheet T1 as ‘Imports’ and add the ‘Clean step’ to the flow.

<center>
![Figure 5: Clean Step](img/5.jpg){width=40%}

</center>
The data table which was cleaned by data interpreter is displayed as shown below.

<center>
![Figure 6: Table After Cleaning](img/6.jpg){width=90%}

</center>

If you can notice, the first five rows are removed and the correct table header is assigned automatically.

3.	The country names are listed under column ‘Variables’. But since we are interested in only the 6 countries given in the visualization, use the filter function next to the ‘Variables’ column to filter out the 6 countries.

<center>
![Figure 7: Filter Values Dialog Box](img/7.jpg){width=80%}

</center>
4.	Since we are interested only in the year 2019-2020, drop all the other data range by selecting the desired date range and clicking on ‘Remove Field’.

<center>
![Figure 8: Selecting Multiple Columns](img/8.jpg)

</center>

Repeat the steps 1-4 for the second sheet T2 and rename the sheet to ‘Exports’.

5.	The output table obtained is in wide format.  Each month corresponding to the year is listed as separate measure as shown below. Wide format is not suitable for analysis, hence wide format has to be transformed to long format.

<center>
![Figure 9: Measure Values](img/9.jpg){width=20%}

</center>

<center>
![Figure 10: Wide Format Columns](img/10.jpg){width=65%}

</center>
Hence, after clean step add pivot step to convert wide format to long format and rename the columns as shown below.

<center>
![Figure 11: Pivot Columns to Rows](img/11.jpg){width=70%}

</center>

<center>
![Figure 12: Long Format Columns](img/12.jpg){width=50%}

</center>
6.	After pivoting and renaming the columns, both the sheets are saved into separate excel sheets namely ‘Imports.xlsx’ and ‘Exports.xlsx’.

<center>
![Figure 13: Final Flow Diagram](img/13.jpg){width=60%}

</center>
7.	Now import both the sheets into Tableau. Drag any one of the tables to the canvas and double click on the table to open the join canvas (physical layer).

<center>
![Figure 14: Imports Table In Tableau](img/14.jpg){width=30%}

</center>
8.	Drag another table to the join canvas.

<center>
![Figure 15: Inner Join Imports And Exports](img/15.jpg)

</center>

As ‘Country’ and ‘Date’ columns are common to both the tables, we can use an inner join to join both the tables as shown in the screenshot. The final table after joining both the tables is shown below.

<center>
![Figure 16: Table After Inner Join](img/16.jpg){width=95%}

</center>
9.	Now date column and country column of any one of the tables is retained as both will have the same value. Country column is split with ‘(‘ as delimiter to retain only the country names.

<center>
![Figure 17: Custom Split](img/17.jpg){width=40%}

</center>

Date column has data type as string. It has to be changed to date data type.
The final table looks like below.

<center>
![Figure 18: Columns After Custom Split And Data Type Change](img/18.jpg){width=60%}

</center>
10.	The scale in the raw data file is in thousand dollars, so both the ‘Import Amount’ and ‘Export Amount’ are to be multiplied by 1000 to get the actual value of imports and exports.

<center>
![Figure 19: Derived Column Import (SGD)](img/19.jpg){width=50%}

</center>

The new calculated columns are named as ‘Import (SGD)’ and ‘Export (SGD)’.

11.	A calculated column ‘Total Trade (SGD)’ is obtained by summing both the ‘Import (SGD)’ and ‘Export (SGD)’.

<center>
![Figure 20: Derived Column Total Trade](img/20.jpg){width=50%}

</center>
12.	Drag ‘Country’ and ‘Date’ to columns pane.

<center>
![Figure 21: Columns Pane](img/21.jpg){width=48%}

</center>
13.	Drag ‘Measure Values’ to rows pane.

<center>
![Figure 22: Rows Pane](img/22.jpg){width=48%}

</center>
14.	‘Measure Values’ consists of 6 values as shown below.

<center>
![Figure 23: Measure Values Content](img/23.jpg){width=25%}

</center>

Remove ‘CNT(Imports)’ , ‘SUM(Export Amount)’, ‘SUM(Import Amount)’ and ‘SUM(Total Trade (SGD))’ from the ‘Measure Values’ column. The chart looks like below.

<center>
![Figure 24: Bar Chart](img/24.jpg)

</center>
15.	Now drag and drop ‘Measure Names’ on color icon under the ‘Marks’ box. Under color icon click on ‘Edit colors’ and select the desired colors.

<center>
![Figure 25: Marks Pane](img/25.jpg){width=25%}

</center>

The stacked bar chart is ready as shown below.

<center>
![Figure 26: Stacked Bar Chart](img/26.jpg)

</center>
16.	Now the derived column, ‘Total Trade (SGD)’ is dragged to column pane.

<center>
![Figure 27: Rows And Columns Pane](img/27.jpg){width=48%}

</center>

17.	Right click on the ‘Total Trade’ chart’s y-axis and click on the ‘Dual Axis’.

<center>
![Figure 28: Dual Axis](img/28.jpg){width=27%}

</center>
18.	Now the ‘Total Trade’ bar chart overlaps the stacked bar chart as the dual axis are in the same scale. Since both the axis are same, hide the y-axis present towards the right as it might confuse the readers.

<center>
![Figure 29: Edit Axis](img/29.jpg){width=40%}

</center>
19.	Click on the dropdown symbol next to ‘SUM(Total Trade (SGD)’ and change the chart type from bar to line.

<center>
![Figure 30: Change Chart Type](img/30.jpg){width=20%}

</center>
20.	Now drag the ‘Total Trade (SGD)’ column onto ‘Label’ icon. Total sum of the trade corresponding to that year is displayed on all the bars.

<center>
![Figure 31: Add Labels](img/31.jpg){width=25%}

</center>
21.	Click the dropdown next to ‘SUM(Total Trade (SGD))’ label and select ‘Percent Difference’ from ‘Quick Table Calculation’.

<center>
![Figure 32: Calculate Percentage Difference](img/32.jpg){width=40%}

</center>
22.	Click on the ‘Add Table Calculation’ and select ‘Pane (Across)’  under compute method.

<center>

![Figure 33: Add Table Calculation](img/33.jpg){width=25%}

</center>
23.	Make the tick marks in the y-axis visible to naked eye since it is on a continuous scale.

24.	Right click on the white space in the chart and click on ‘Annotate’ to add annotations to highlight key insights.

<center>
![Figure 34: Add Annotations](img/34.jpg){width=30%}

</center>
25.	The final chart is ready after adding title, axis labels and captions.

<center>
![Figure 35: Final Visualisation](img/35.jpg)

## 5.0	Derived Insights

1.	Out of the top six trading partners of Singapore, Mainland China has the highest merchandise trade value of S$137.31 billion and S$136.2 billion for the years 2019 and 2020 respectively.
2.	Except for Taiwan and Hong Kong, the total trade value of the remaining four countries decreased in the year 2020 from that of the previous year.
3.	 Malaysia had the steepest fall of 8.46% in total trade value in the year 2020 from that of the previous year whereas, on the other hand, Taiwan witnessed the highest increase of 13.04% in the total trade value from that of the previous year.
4.	The value of import for Singapore’s trade with Hong Kong only contributes less than 8% in both the years 2019 and 2020 of the total trade.
